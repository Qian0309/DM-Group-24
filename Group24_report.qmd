# Project Introduction

In our comprehensive project, we are aimed at creating a e-commerce database, focusing on IT products within the United Kingdom. Our project is divided into four pivotal stages, each contributing to the development and understanding of our e-commerce platform. 

# Part 1: Database Design and Implementation

## Task 1.1: E-R Diagram Design and Relationship Sets

In this report, we assume that the E-commerce platform primarily sells IT products within the UK and lacks an international shipment policy. Additionally, the company’s policy dictates that only be promoted once a year. Each "Product_ID" is determined by its "Supplier_ID," indicating that a supplier can only assign one "Product_ID" to each product. Furthermore, the E-commerce company collects payments and distributes them to suppliers later. There are 7 entities:

1)  Buyer: Represents the customers who create an account to place orders on the online shopping platform.

2)  Supplier: Represents the sellers who create an account to sell products on the platform

3)  Product: Represents the set of products available for purchase on the platform.

4)  Transaction: Represents product orders placed by customers.

5)  Promotion: Represents product promotions to attract willing customers.

6)  Shipper: Represents shipper information.

7)  Reviews: Represents the reviews made by the customer once the product is received.

The Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram for our e-commerce database before normalization is shown below:

## Task 1.2: SQL Database Schema Creation

The Conceptual Schema explained in Section 1.1 is 

### Conceputual Schema of the Database after Normalisation

~~The E-R diagram after normalization is shown below.~~

![](Figures\Screenshots\ERD\ERD_after_normalization.png){fig-align="center"}

### Logical Schema of the Database after Normalisation

* product(product _id, product _name, product _description, weight, price, promotion_id, dimension_id , supplier_id) 

* promotion(promotion_id, promotion_type, start_date, end_date, status) 

* buyer(buyer_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, address_id) 

*supplier(Supplier_ID, Supplier_Name, Supplier_Type, Contract_Type, Number_of_year_of_association, address_id) 

* review(review_id, review_score, review_description, product_id, buyer_id) 

*payment(payment_id, payment_type, payment_amount, installment_number, order_id) 

* shipper(Shipper_ID, Shipper_Name, Service, Fixed Price, Cost_per_mile) 

* order_details(order_id, product_id, buyer_id, supplier_id, order_dates, shipper_id) 

* address(address_id, house_number, house_name, street, city, county, post_code) 

* dimension(Dimension_ID, Length, Width, Height) 

### Relationship Sets after Normalization

We've conceptualised 12 relationship sets to effectively model and manage the data structure underlying our E-commerce operations. (consider to drop: ~~These sets illustrate how different entities within our ecosystem interact and connect with one another, providing a comprehensive overview for stakeholders.~~) Below is a detailed summary of these critical relationships:

1)  Buyer and Address (1:1):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\buyer_address(1_1).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This diagram shows one-to-one relationship between buyers and addresses,~~ it also indicates that each buyer has one address, and each address is associated with one buyer.

2)  Buyer and Order Details (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\buyer_order(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This shows a one-to-many relationship,~~ indicating a buyer can place multiple orders, with each 'order detail' linked to a single 'buyer'.

3)  Buyer and Reviews (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\buyer_review(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This shows a one-to-many relationship,~~ meaning a buyer can submit multiple reviews, with each review associated with that buyer.

4)  Order Details and Payment (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\order_payment(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~It shows a one-to-many relationship,~~ meaning each order detail can involve multiple transactions, with each transaction corresponding to a specific order detail.

5)  Product to Dimension (1:1):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\product_dimension(1_1).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This represents a one-to-one relationship,~~ indicating each product has a unique set of dimensions, with each set of dimensions tied to a single product.

6)  Product to Order Details (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\product_order(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This represents a one-to-many relationship between product and order details.~~ meaning that one product can be present in many order details, Conversely, each order detail is associated with only one product, indicating a specific product is selected for each order.

7)  Product to Promotion (N:1):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\Product_Promotion(n_1).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This represents a many-to-one relationship~~ indicating that multiple products can be part of the same promotion. Conversely, each promotion can apply to multiple products.

8)  Product to Review (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\Product_Review(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~Represents a one-to-many relationship,~~ showing that each product can have multiple reviews written about it, Conversely, each review is associated with one product, indicating that customers’ feedback is specific to a particular product

9)  Supplier and Order Details (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\shipper_order(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This illustrates a one-to-many relationship,~~ showing that a single supplier can be connected to multiple order details, with each order detail relating to only one supplier.

10) Supplier and Address (1:1):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\supplier_address(1_1).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This represents a one-to-one relationship,~~ where each supplier is tied to a single address, and each address is linked to a specific supplier

11) Supplier and Order Details (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\supplier_order(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This illustrates a one-to-many relationship,~~ showing that a single supplier can be connected to multiple order details, with each order detail relating to only one supplier.

12) Supplier and Product (1:N):

![](Figures\Screenshots\relationship_set\supplier_product(1_n).png){fig-align="center"}

~~This shows a one-to-many relationship,~~ indicating that a supplier sells many products. One supplier can be linked to multiple 'product' entities.

### Physical Schema of the Database

Now, we can Translate the E-R diagram into a functional SQL database schema (normalized to up to 3NF), define tables with appropriate data types, constraints, primary and foreign keys.

#### Table Description for Promotions

```{r}
# Define the table data
promotion_table <- data.frame(
  `Field Name` = c("promotion_id", "promotion_type", "start_date", "end_date", "status"),
  `Data Type` = c("VARCHAR(50)", "VARCHAR(50)", "DATE", "DATE", "VARCHAR(50)"),
  `Constraints` = c("PRIMARY KEY", "", "", "", ""),
  `Description` = c("Unique identifier for promotion", "Type of promotion", "Promotion start date", "Promotion end date", "Status of the promotion")
)

# Create the table
kable(promotion_table, caption = "Table Description for Promotions", align = 'l')
```

Indexing in databases, such as on the promotion_id field of a Promotion table, speeds up data retrieval by maintaining a separate, efficient data structure (like a B-tree) that maps keys to their respective rows in the table. This automatic indexing on primary keys as the first column allows for quick searches, insertions, and ensures uniqueness, enhancing query performance significantly. Indexing foreign key columns as the second key is crucial for enhancing the performance of join operations between tables

For other columns without explicit indexing, queries that search or filter by these fields may perform a full table scan, which is slower.

#### Table Description for Shippers

```{r}
# Define the table data for the shipper table
shipper_table <- data.frame(
  `Field Name` = c("shipper_id", "shipper_name", "service", "fixed_price", "cost_per_mile"),
  `Data Type` = c("VARCHAR(50)", "VARCHAR(50)", "VARCHAR(100)", "DOUBLE", "DOUBLE"),
  `Constraints` = c("PRIMARY KEY", "", "", "", ""),

                    "Name of the shipper", 
                    "Type of service offered by the shipper", 
                    "Fixed price for the service",

                    "Street name", 
                    "City name", 
                    "County name",

  `Constraints` = c("PRIMARY KEY", "", "", ""),
  `Description` = c("Unique identifier for the dimension record", 
                    "Length measurement", 
                    "Width measurement", 
                    "Height measurement")

  `Description` = c("Unique identifier for the supplier", 
                    "Type of supplier (e.g., goods, services)", 
                    "Type of contract with the supplier",

# Part 2: Data Generation and Management

## Task 2.1: Synthetic Data Generation

In the process of synthetic data generation, we use a combination of R, Mockaroo, and Excel to simulate a dataset that closely mimics real-world scenarios. Our dataset consists of 10 distinct entities that represent all the components in our system.

Mockaroo: For several entities we use Mockaroo to create data such as addresses, emails, and names.

R studios: We use R scripts to simulate the data distributions, especially in product, promotion, all the ID’s, and date related attributes, we wanted to make sure that the synthetic data reflects realistic variability and complexity.

Excel: After we imported the data from R and mockaroo, we combined the foreign keys. We use ‘Randbwteen’ features to ensure that the inter-entity relationships are accurately represented.

## Task 2.2: Data Import and Quality Assurance

The synthetic data, generated in .csv format, is imported. The data undergoes various integrity and validation checks, detailed below:

### Data Integrity:

1) Primary Key fields:

No NA/NULL values are allowed in the primary key attributes of any entities. The primary key ID must follow the format specified in Section 2.1.

2) Date fields:

No future dates should appear in any date field. This includes the Date of Birth of buyers, Promotion start and end dates, and Order dates.

3) Product entity:

The weight of the product must not exceed 100 pounds

4) Promotion entity:

The end date of a promotion must be later than its start date.

5) Review entity:

Review scores must not exceed 10.

6) Address entity:

Length of postcode should be only 5 or 6 characters in accordance with postcode of UK residents.

7) Dimension entity:

The Length, Width, and Height of a product must not exceed 150 cm.

8) Non-Negativity:

All numeric attributes of float or integer type must not have negative values. This includes Weight, Price, Years of Association, Review Score, Payment Value, Installment Number, Fixed Price, Cost per Mile, Length, Width, Height, and House Number.

### Referential Integrity :

Referential integrity checks are conducted for all relationships discussed in Section 1.1. For example, in the Product to Review (1:N) relationship, the Review entity's Product_ID, serving as a foreign key, indicates a specific product's review in the E-commerce system. Referential integrity ensures no review is entered for a product not present in the system. To validate, unique Product_ID keys from the Review table are compared with those from the Product table; the difference should be NULL or 0. A non-zero value indicates the presence of a Product_ID in the Review table that doesn't match any in the Product table, violating referential integrity. Such records are removed from the Review table.

# Part 3: Data Pipeline Generation

## Task 3.1: GitHub Repository and Workflow Setup

To allow group members to collaborate on the project simultaneously we have adopted the use of a remote repository (an online storage system for our project’s history) on GitHub. This online platform serves as a centralised storage for our project's history, enabling efficient management and version control.

(IMAGE)

Integrating our project with Posit Cloud, we used the HTTPS clone URL from GitHub to establish a connection between our local and remote repositories directly within Posit Cloud. This integration streamlined our workflow by providing a centralised platform for development, enabling efficient access and management of the project's codebase.

(IMAGE)

To streamline our project management and enhance version control among team members, we utilised commit, push, and pull operations effectively. By committing changes before pushing, we enabled team members to save the state of our project at specific points following any modifications made in our local repositories. This process not only enables detailed tracking of who made specific changes and why, but also ensures that each contribution is reviewed before being shared with the team.

Pushing these commits to the remote repository then publishes each member's contributions, ensuring everyone is working on the most updated version. Regularly pulling updates from the remote repository is crucial for keeping our local copies current, significantly reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts between the local and remote version after changes are made.

These practices have collectively created a robust collaborative environment, significantly boosting our productivity and streamlining the project's progression.

## Task 3.2: GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration

GitHub Workflows automate processes within a repository using YAML files. We started by creating a `.github/workflows/` directory to house our workflow files. Then, we added a file named "ETL workflow for group24" within this directory to outline our specific automated tasks, focusing on the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes crucial to our project's data handling needs, enhancing efficiency.

The workflow is summarised on the following page

{IMAGE}

Next, we add the following code.

(CODE)

(IMAGE)

In this phase of configuring our GitHub Workflow, we set the trigger condition to activate on every push event to the repository. This configuration ensures that any time changes are pushed or a pull request is merged, the workflow initiates automatically. Following a thorough review of the code to confirm its accuracy and completeness, we commit and push these updates to our GitHub repository.

In the workflow of our project, we automate the data quality check, data ingestion into the database, and basic data analysis in the R script "Data_Validation_Import_Script.R", and the advanced data analysis in the R script "Advanced_Data_Analysis.R". Everytime new data files are added to the data folder in the local repository, the push request triggers actions including the validation of new data, updating the database with the cleaned new data, and automatically saving the visualizations produced by the advanced data analysis into the folder "Advanced_Data_Analysis".

With this action, the workflow file under GitHub Actions is now operational, and it automatically executes the predefined tasks each time a change is made to the repository, without manual intervention.
